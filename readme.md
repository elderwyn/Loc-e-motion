## ⚙️ Core Tycoon Systems

### 1. Emotional Energy Generation
Each car continuously produces its unique energy once unlocked.  
Players can:
- **Manually collect** energy at early stages.  
- **Automate** generation by investing upgrades.  
- See animated workers/NPCs reflecting the emotion’s mood.

### 2. Refinement & Fusion
At The Empathion, players **refine** raw emotional energy into higher-tier resources:
- Combine multiple emotions to form **Harmony Points**.  
- Example: `Joy Tokens + Rage Cores → Passion Sparks`  
- Higher tiers unlock new tech trees or cosmetic effects.

### 3. Car Upgrades
Each emotion car has a 3-tier upgrade system:
- **Tier I – Activation:** Basic production unlocked.  
- **Tier II – Empowerment:** Adds mini-games & boosts yield.  
- **Tier III – Automation:** Produces energy passively.  

Upgrades visually change each car (more light, motion, or NPCs).

### 4. The Empathion Core
Acts as the **master control** and prestige center.
- Stores total Harmony Energy.  
- Allows prestige resets for *Permanent Multiplier Bonuses*.  
- Visually evolves with every major upgrade (more colors, faster pulse).
